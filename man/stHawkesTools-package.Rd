\title{stHawkesTools: Provide Tools for Bootstrapping General Spatio-Temporal Hawkes Processes}
\description{
stHawkesTools is an R package for simulating, estimating, and analyzing spatio-temporal Hawkes processes. It supports flexible triggering kernels beyond those implemented in existing packages like ETAS, and provides simulation tools tailored for spatio-temporal settings. Parameter estimation is performed using the EM algorithm for maximum likelihood inference. The package also offers confidence intervals based on both asymptotic theory and a range of bootstrap methods. Additional utilities are included to support diagnostics and model-based analysis of spatio-temporal point process data.
