\title{Estimate the covariance matrix of the MLE using observed information}
\usage{
hessian_est(hawkes, est)
}
\arguments{
\item{hawkes}{A \code{hawkes} object.}

\item{est}{A \code{hawkes_fit} object from \code{hawkes_mle()}.}
}
\value{
A named covariance matrix corresponding to the estimated parameters.
}
\description{
Computes the observed information matrix (negative Hessian of the log-likelihood) and
returns its inverse as an estimated covariance matrix for Hawkes model parameters.
}
\details{
Requires the \pkg{numDeriv} package. The Hessian of the full log-likelihood is
approximated with central differences. The negative Hessian is inverted and its row and
column names are matched to the flattened parameter vector.
